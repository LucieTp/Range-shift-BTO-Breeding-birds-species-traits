# Range-shift-BTO-breeding-birds

This code implements the analysis of the relationship between species traits in and British breeding birds' range shift.

R code 1 processes data from the BTO, extracts environmental variables, runs the SDMs for the 160 initial species and computes range shift.
R code 2 computes/extratcs the species traits (biotic, abiotic and dispersal capabilities) and creates the main data file for modelling
R code 3 runs the analysis (PGLMMs) and exports the results
R code 4 generates most plots and other minor statistical analysis (wilcox tests etc).
